
This is a set of scripts that has been developed to make me live a better life. There are MANY
people who know a lot about networking (routing/switching), and MANY people who know a lot about
security (firewall/DPI/nexus). Those who know about networking sometimes know something about 
security, and vice-versa.

But there only A FEW people who know something about networking and security, who also know
something about programming and scripting languages (Javascript, php, perl). So there are only a few
people who also can imagine how helpful this can be, and how much time this can save you.
I can't count the number of times I saved my mental sanity and that of some of my colleagues,
by writing scripts to convert configurations (from CatOS to IOS), analyze configurations, perform
tasks that where very long but always the same for MANY times. This does not only save time, but also
dramatically decreases the error probability and improves your work quality.


To successfully "install" the scripts and having them working, you will need to know the following:
- installing apache or any other web server
- installing php (possibly the last version)
- be able to write/understand php and perl scripts


I believe that this already excludes 99% of you ... because if you reached this project, you probably
work in the networking world, thus you will not know anything of the above.
In this case, it is probably better if you don't even try to download the scripts zip file, because 
you will NOT be able to use them. Anyway you could go on reading about the features of this set
of scripts, to understand what is the power of programming languages. Maybe you will decide to hire
someone who can do the job for you :-)


For those who can continue, the scripts are not perfect (to be polite with myself ...) and for sure
they could be improved in many ways (for example, some environment variables should 
be centralized and included in a single text file ... i'm pretty sure it's not like this right now).

If you have any idea to help in providing an easier to install/use set of files, you are very welcome.
Contact me and we can work about it. Also ideas about new feature are nice, expecially if you also
provide the scripts already :-)
